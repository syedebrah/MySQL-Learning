-- Using Temporary Tables
-- Temporary tables are tables that are only visible to the session that created them. 
-- They can be used to store intermediate results for complex queries or to manipulate data before inserting it into a permanent table.

-- There's 2 ways to create temp tables:
-- 1. This is the less commonly used way - which is to build it exactly like a real table and insert data into it

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table
(first_name varchar(50),
last_name varchar(50),
favorite_movie varchar(100)
);

select * from temp_table;

INSERT INTO temp_table
VALUES ('Alex','Freberg','Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers');

-- now when we run it and execute it again we have our data
SELECT *
FROM temp_table;

-- use case of temp table
SELECT *
FROM employee_salary;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE emp_salary_50k
SELECT *
FROM employee_salary
where salary >= 50000;

select * from emp_salary_50k;


-- It is only get available with in the session only
